# STUDENT-PERCENTAGE-PREDICTOR
In this project, I have developed a Machine Learning model using the Linear Regression algorithm. The dataset
was in CSV format, and I conducted essential data pre-processing and visualization techniques. By utilizing the
Matplotlib library, I created a graph to illustrate how the Linear Regression model functions.
With this model, you can input the number of hours a student has studied, and it will predict the potential
percentage that the student may score in their examinations based on their study hours.
